# What They Never Told Me About Mathematics

---

For most of my school years, I thought mathematics didn't like me.

I wasn't alone in this. Most people I know have a similar story: somewhere between fractions and quadratic functions, something jammed. The teacher talked, the blackboard filled up, and silence grew in my head. Formulas had to be memorized because "that's how it is." Definitions had to be drilled because "it'll be on the test."

Nobody said *why*.

It took me years to understand that the problem wasn't with me. The problem was that nobody showed me what mathematics actually *is*. Not *how to use it* — they showed that. But what it *is*.

Today I'll try to say what they never told me.

## Apples and Symbols

You have 20 dollars in your wallet. You go to the store. A bag of apples costs 5 dollars. You want to know how much you'll have left if you buy one.

What do you do?

You don't think about apples. You don't think about paper bills. Something like this appears in your head:

*20 - 5 = 15*

Fifteen. You'll have fifteen dollars left.

That took maybe a second. But in that second, something extraordinary happened:

1. You took **reality** (wallet, apples, prices) and converted it into **symbols** (20, 5)
2. You performed an **operation on symbols** according to known rules (subtraction)
3. You got a **new symbol** (15)
4. You translated the symbol back into **reality** (you know how much will remain in your wallet)

And that is all of mathematics.

All of it.

I'm not joking.

## The Magic of Compression

What I just described is the most powerful tool humanity has ever invented.

We take the chaos of the world — apples, money, planets, bridges, cells, sound waves — and *compress* it into symbols. Symbols are small, handy, easy to manipulate. We can transform them according to rules we ourselves established.

And then we *decompress* the result back into the world.

And the world agrees.

You buy apples, exactly as much remains in your wallet as you calculated. You build a bridge according to calculations, the bridge stands. You send a rocket to the Moon, the rocket lands where it was supposed to.

Symbols *remember* reality. Manipulation of symbols *transforms* that memory. And the result *returns* to the world and works.

This is not obvious. It's actually insane. Why would marks on paper have anything to do with apples?

And yet they do.

## What They Never Told Me (Part One)

Nobody told me that mathematics is a **way of talking about relationships between things**.

Not about numbers. Not about formulas. About *relationships*.

You have five apples and three pears. What can you say about this?

- There are *more* apples than pears (relationship)
- Together you have *eight* fruits (relationship between sets and their sum)
- If you eat one apple, you'll have *the same number* of apples as pears plus one (relationship)

Numbers are just labels. The real content is relationships: more, less, equal, contained in, follows from, is part of.

Our brain naturally thinks about the world as **objects** and **relationships** between them. Mathematics is simply a way to talk about these relationships *precisely* and *in writable form*.

## What They Never Told Me (Part Two)

Nobody told me that there are things we **don't define**.

In school they make you memorize definitions. A point is... a line is... a set is...

But the truth is: you can't define everything. Every definition uses other words that would also need to be defined, and so on to infinity.

So mathematicians do something clever: they choose a few things that they *accept without definition*. They call them **primitive notions**.

For Euclidean geometry, the primitive notions are *point*, *line*, *plane*. We don't explain what they are. We accept that everyone somehow understands.

For set theory, the primitive notions are *set* and *membership in a set*. We don't define what a set is. We assume you intuitively know — a set of apples, a set of numbers, a set of your friends. And you know what it means for something to *belong* to a set or not.

This is the foundation. Everything else we build on this.

---

## What They Never Told Me (Part Three)

Nobody told me what the difference is between a **primitive notion** and an **axiom**.

A primitive notion is a word we accept without definition. ("Set")

An axiom is a sentence we accept without proof. ("Two sets are equal if they have the same elements")

Together they form the starting point. The foundation on which we build everything else.

And this is beautiful: if you change the axioms, you get a *different* mathematics. Not worse, not wrong — different. Euclidean geometry has an axiom about parallel lines. Change it, and you get spherical geometry (like on a globe) or hyperbolic geometry (like in Escher's paintings).

Mathematics is not discovering the only truth carved somewhere in the cosmos. Mathematics is building consistent systems on chosen foundations.

## Cantor and Sets

At the end of the 19th century, mathematician Georg Cantor proposed something bold: let's build *all* of mathematics on one primitive notion.

That notion is the **set**.

A set is... well, we don't define it. But intuitively: a collection of things. A set of apples. A set of even numbers. A set of all triangles.

And the only relation we need is **membership**: an element belongs to a set or it doesn't.

And now the magic: from this one notion we can build everything.

An ordered pair (a, b)? It's a special set.

Natural numbers? Sets.

A function? A set of pairs.

Yes, a function — that scary thing from high school — is simply a set of pairs. The function f(x) = x² is a set of pairs: {(0,0), (1,1), (2,4), (3,9), ...}. To each x we assign exactly one y. That's it.

The graph of a function that you draw in your notebook? That *is* the function. Not a picture of it — the function itself.

If they had told me this in high school, I would have saved myself many sleepless nights.

## Why It Works

When everything is a set, everything speaks the same language.

Geometry, algebra, analysis, probability theory — underneath, the same concepts, the same rules. You can take tools from one field and use them in another, because the foundation is shared.

That's why a mathematician can work on a problem from physics, using tools from topology, and get a result that makes sense in biology. It's not magic. It's a common language.

And a common language comes from a common foundation.

And nobody told me this.

## Two Layers

Once I understood this, I saw that mathematics operates on two layers simultaneously.

**The symbolic layer**: you manipulate marks on paper. You transform expressions. You apply rules. You don't think about meaning, only about form. Left side equals right side? Good, move on.

**The meaning layer**: you think about what the symbols *mean*. A function is not just a set of pairs — it's a machine that takes input and gives output. An integral is not just a symbol — it's the area under a curve.

And you jump between these layers. Sometimes you look at symbols, transform them mechanically. Sometimes you look at meaning to know what you're actually doing.

Masters of mathematics do this fluidly, unconsciously. Beginners don't know these layers exist. They think there's only one — the symbolic layer — and that mathematics is memorizing which symbols can be swapped for which.

And then they get lost. Because without meaning, symbols are empty marks.

## What I Would Have Liked to Hear

If I could go back to my first mathematics lesson, I would like to hear something like this:

*Listen. Mathematics is a way of talking about the world. You take things you see — apples, money, distances — and convert them into symbols. Then you play with the symbols according to established rules. And at the end, you can convert the result back into reality.*

*Underneath, there are a few concepts we accept without definition — set, membership. And a few sentences we accept without proof — axioms. On this we build everything else.*

*And one more thing: the result of manipulating symbols can surprise you. You can discover something you didn't know when you started. That's the power of mathematics — symbols "remember" meaning and can show you things you wouldn't see on your own.*

That would have been enough. Twenty minutes. And everything else would have made sense.

## In Closing

I'm not a mathematician. I don't have a degree. What I've written here, I squeezed out of books and lecturers over years.

But I think that's precisely why I can say it more simply than they can. For them it's breathing — they don't remember that they once didn't know this. For me it's hard-won knowledge.

Mathematics isn't hard because it's complicated. It's hard because nobody says plainly what it's about. We get tools without instructions. Definitions without context. Formulas without foundations.

And then we think we're stupid.

We're not.

It's just that nobody told us.
